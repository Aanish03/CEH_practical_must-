RainbowCrack 1.8 readme

Introduction
--------------------------------
RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin's faster time-memory trade-off technique.
It crack hashes with rainbow tables.

Documentation is available at http://project-rainbowcrack.com/.

Version History
--------------------------------
Changes in version 1.8
- Support GPU acceleration in Linux
- Support latest AMD and NVIDIA GPUs
