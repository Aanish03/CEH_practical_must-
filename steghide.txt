SYNOPSIS
       steghide command [ arguments ]


EXTRACTING
       If you have received a file that contains a  message  that
       has  been  embedded with steghide, use the extract command
       to extract it. The following arguments can  be  used  with
       this command.


       -sf, --stegofile filename
              Specify  the  stego  file  (the  file that contains
              embedded data). If  this  argument  is  omitted  or
              filename is -, steghide will read a stego file from
              standard input.


       -xf, --extractfile filename
              Create a file with the name filename and write  the
              data that is embedded in the stego file to it. This
              option overrides the filename that is embedded  int
              the  stego  file.  If this argument is omitted, the
              embedded data will be saved to the  current  direcÂ­
              tory under its original name.

EXAMPLES
       The basic usage is as follows:

         $ steghide embed -cf picture.jpg -ef secret.txt
         Enter passphrase:
         Re-Enter passphrase:
         embedding "secret.txt" in "picture.jpg"... done

       This  command  will embed the file secret.txt in the cover
       file picture.jpg.

       and you want to  get  some  information  about  it  before
       extracting it, use the info command:

         $ steghide info received_file.wav
         "received_file.wav":
           format: wave audio, PCM encoding
           capacity: 3.5 KB
